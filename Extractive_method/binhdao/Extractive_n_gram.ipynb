Nhất cận thị, nhị cận giang, ai cũng nghĩ như vậy nên người đến mua đất, xây nhà, làm quán quanh chợ dần đông hơn. Nhưng đường sá thì ngày càng hẹp đi, nhếch nhác và nguy hiểm. Chúng tôi may mắn lớn lên bình an. Nhưng có nhiều gia đình không có được niềm hạnh phúc ấy. Tôi vẫn nhớ như in một buổi sáng cuối năm, đó là phiên chợ Tết. Người dân bày đủ thứ, từ bóng bay, hoa thược dược, gà, ngan, gạo nếp... ra ven đường để bán. Chợ mới họp được chừng hai tiếng thì một chiếc xe tải, trong khi cố tránh những gánh hàng rong, đã đâm vào quán cắt may của ông Quỳnh thương binh. Ông Quỳnh chỉ còn một chân nên không kịp chạy.
